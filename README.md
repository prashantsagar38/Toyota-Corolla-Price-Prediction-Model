# Toyota-Corolla-Price-Prediction-Model

## Project Overview:
</br>
This project aims to predict the price of Toyota Corolla cars using multiple linear regression analysis. The dataset includes various attributes related to the cars, such as age, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. By applying exploratory data analysis (EDA), multiple linear regression models, and regularization techniques, we aim to understand the key factors influencing car prices and develop a predictive model with high accuracy.

## Dataset Description:
</br>
The dataset used in this project includes the following variables:

- Age: Age of the car in years.
* KM: Accumulated kilometers on the odometer.
+ FuelType: Type of fuel used (Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
- HP: Horse Power of the car.
* Automatic: Transmission type (Yes=1, No=0).
+ CC: Cylinder volume in cubic centimeters.
- Doors: Number of doors in the car.
* Weight: Weight of the car in kilograms.
+ Quarterly_Tax: Quarterly tax value.
- Price: Offer price of the car in euros.

## Project Tasks:

- Perform initial data exploration to gain insights into the dataset.
* Generate summary statistics and visualizations to understand variable distributions and relationships.

## Data Preprocessing:

- Handle missing values and data inconsistencies.
* Encode categorical variables and normalize/standardize numerical features as needed.
+ Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

## Model Building:

- Develop multiple linear regression models using the training dataset.
* Interpret the coefficients of the models to understand the influence of each feature.
+ Experiment with a minimum of three different regression models to compare performance.

## Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* Assess the effectiveness of the models on the testing dataset.


## Tools and Libraries:
- Programming Languages: Python
* Data Manipulation Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
+ Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Modeling Libraries: statsmodels
* Notebooks/IDE: Google Colab
</br>

## Results:
- Detailed findings from the exploratory data analysis.
* Coefficients and interpretations from the multiple linear regression models.
+ Performance metrics for the regression models.
